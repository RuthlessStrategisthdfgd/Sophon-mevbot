# kontain-build

This directory just contains a `Makefile` that creates a package of the Kontain
components needed for the VRRB compute runtime. The package is currently a
tarball as a placeholder, but will later be an IPLD blob suitable for posting
to IPFS, including everything being content-addressable.

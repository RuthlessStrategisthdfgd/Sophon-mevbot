# VRRB Playground

## Description
A simple playground for testing out VRRB. Utilizes the API router that Next.js provides to create a simple UI for interacting with VRRB via RPC.

## Prerequisites
* a [VRRB node](https://github.com/vrrb-io/vrrb) running locally on port `:9293`

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:vrrb-io/vrrb-playground.git`
2. Change to cloned repo `cd vrrb-playground`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to start interacting with VRRB via RPC

## Future Plans
* Add UI to VRRB repo to be spun up with the node at runtime.
